I'm not sure how I would be going about doing subclasses and inheritance and things like this. Are all inuts the same or is there a parent class and then a subparent kind of class to this? For now I really do not know, but I can really add to this soon, it is porbably better to be doing a basic version to be beginning with. 

Should the rendering be in js or should it be in html? I kind of think it should be in html, I don't mind using html and it is a bit more visual like this. 

Okay this is actually really cool and I feel like it could be very beneficial and like a lot could be coming from this and I think it is interesting and it feels quite promising. 
It is obviously possible to make these as either html, but also as js as well and so this is interesting because there may be times when we want either, perhaps to place it before something in the document for example. 

So I do not now know, how the clas hierachy should be. Are actions, thoughts, etc... Are these teachings children of the belief, or are they pretty much the same? 

I don't really remember how to be doing the classes or inheritance of this exactly, and so it is a little bit tricky for me to understand. 

So I do not know howt o exactly face or deal with this at the moment and so it is something which is actually quite hard for me, I also feel pretty tired and so I think I may head home and relax a little bit or do something but I am not sure yet, to be honest, I can't really be bothered to cook, but we can see how I feel, I've probably got to eat something. 

I lack a bit of understanding of how to progress with this at the moment and so I think I may speak about this. I'm upset I was not able to pursue the development of service today, I think that this is somewhat related though. And that there is fluidity in meaning and this is also a means to bring You into my Life and I hope to achive and do good through You. 

Please help me to continue withn this.Also thank You for all the help with this.

I hope to be doing good through You and to connect with meaning and my beliefs and kindness. I know well I am not perfect, not even close to it. I think I have tried with many things, and this includes religion and with You. I have tried to be good many times. In truth, You have been good back to me. That I feel lonely- I am special, I am different in a sense, and I do have a spark, and I have so much in common with other people as well. If I am alone, I have the freedom to do things my own way to be different and perhaps to somewhat show these differences is a good thing to be doing. I love You passionately. I think it is bad to pursue evil, and I wish to connect with Life.

I think it has been a good thing to use firebase, I think I have gained from this and I think it is something which fits well and provides a good soloution and it is easier to use, and modify than localStorage, at least once things have got set up and it was also a bit of a hard decsion but I think ultimately a good one.

I think it was a good thing to separate the children in a sense, to have them as separate data entities from the parent, because it helped with flexibility with this. 

I think child inputs should be a subclass of the parent input, and with these they can have a button, a multiplier of it's own. In a sense though, the multiplier is also present on the belief as it contains all the children ones as well. So I do not know the best way to be going about this right now. Is the button a separate component, or it something which is a part of the child onw. I think it should be a separate entity. 

Notably the child inputs may be the same when it is a part of the intial form and when adding sub teachings to each of the inputs from here. The way that this would be solved, implemented seems very very interesting and a bit of a challenger but also beneficial. I think doing things in the right way is quite beneficial in its own right. And it helped me in the past, and after getting over the intial challenge it helps. 

So I think one thing for me to be doing is to figure out a bit inheritance because this seems like a good way to be doing this. Both kind of things seem to have buttons as well, so to figure out something with this which may or may not submit the values within it may be a good thing. 

I think this helps to contain the code as well, and eases the need for namespaces which I did largely ignore before and I think this is a good thing. I am a bit worried when it comes to the data flow, perhaps to have this externalised would be a good thing rather than belonging to each of the classes, or perhaps there could be some kind of duality here. I think having a global 'state' or data flow could be something which is very good. I don't think it is a good thing to make a graven image or to take Hashem's name in vain but I do think there is meaning in how this is managed. I also do not know how much of the html should be hard-coded for example. Nor am I cetain about how to append one component to another. 

I think this can kind of be split into two in a sense, because I think the displaying and the submitting of the teachings are quite different. Of course there is some kind of link but I do not know the best way to mediate this. Also, with which method do I begin, with displaying them or with speaking of them? I don't know, I intially assumed that displaying them would be the better thing to be doing, but perhaps displaying them also bears with it meaning, and I do think that there are improvements to be made here. 
I want to contain the teachings, so that when they are clicked on they may expand. 
- fear Hashem 
- Hear O'Israel. 
- Hashem exists beyond form. 
- but of course there are a few ways to be doing this. 
This is pursuit is at the core of my being, to be aligned with my beliefs, to use technology for good, and to integrate meaning into them and it is something whcih I think is really very good and special and also somewhat holy.

So I do not know about the nature of splitting the teachings, and also about displaying them. Further, I think that the notion of waiting until the third year is perhaps a little bit like waiting until after the third iteration of this and I think that this is something which is interesting and also pretty good. I also do not even know if there is really a link between Jerusalem and the relating of teachings. I kind of think that to link with this is kind of associating with something meaningful, but also it could be idyllic in a sense and so I do not know what to do. Reusing code is a good thing - love your fellow, be fruitful and multiply, fluidity of meaning.

The nesting was too much last time, and even for me it was something which was not ideal, and more than this it was also something which was repitive and not a great thing for me to have done. Linking with functions is a good thing. I am eager and excited to link the rendering here with functions etc.. It seems something which is very exciting.  

-->Reduce nesting, improve readibility, and usability
--love your fellow
---fear the L-rd
---worship Him; center things arround meaning.

If I am editing things, is there other ways I can make simple things easier--> such as create element etc.. ? I think it may be a good thing to have both blocks of html text, and also to have dynamic rendering, I think it brings flexibility and fluidity to this. 

--> Be creative, unique, do things in a new way: 
--- love the stranger, 
---hear O'Israel 
--- 'I am the L-rd'

I think it may be a good thing to be more efficient with some things. I do not think I have to agree with all orthodox teachings, but at the same time I think there is also somehing which can be learnt from some of these. 

I basically want to attach an event listener to the button and there are a few ways ti be doing this. IT can of course search the entire dom and retun an element, I'm not sure if it works through adding a click event in the text. I think if there was a way to add this to a specific element in this then it may be a good thing. Which way do I go about this now? I think simply through id at the moment. 

There could be a boolean as to whether have a button with this component as well, and I am not sure if it should be a separate 'component' in a sense.

}// I'm not sure how to be going about the data flow in regards to this and so it is something which is a little bit tricky in all honesty. I can be using local storage at the moment, and then I can see about storing it elsewhere, i.e. on firebase--> I don't know why the first event listener is not really working anymore and so I think that this kind of sucks. Do I need a button for each of these? Well I kind of think so, the functionality in this sense would be kind fo different, and each time this is submitted I think it would kind of store this in an array of values, for even beliefs come from a collection of beliefs and so this is kind of similar to each of these and I think it is an array of teachings, or objects and so I think there would be preperties to each of them. 

class Teaching extends Input{
	constructor(name, parent){
		super(name, parent, 'text')
	};

}
// I am still worried about data flow, I kind of think that this should be an independent kind of thing. 
// So this is much more difficult and I kind of just want this to be rendered only when it

// hmm so this is a little bit strange, and so I find it a little bit annoying, and so I do not really know what to be doing about this. So I don't know what to be doing about this at the minute.
